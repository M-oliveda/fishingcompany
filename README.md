# Fishing Company

This is a learning project I created to test my fronted web developer skills.

This website describes a fishing landing page company. Its purpose is to convince the client to reserve a fishing experience with them.

## Website Features

The website is fully responsive and designed using the mobile-first design principle.

Their design adapts from small devices (like smartphones) to bigger ones (larger desktop PCs).

It is developed with the core web technologies: HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript.

It uses the latest CSS technologies such as CSS flexbox and CSS grid.

The JavaScript code is only for form validation and form submission.
